# NetUtilsLoveMI

NetUtilsLoveMI is a little PowerShell prank that I cooked up. This will create a Microsoft.Powershell_profile file into an
individual's Documents\WindowsPowershell directory. I creates a function named NetUtilsLoveMI which is the Mission Impossible theme 
and adds it to the user's profile. Then, it adds an alias for commonly used network utilities that point to the function in
the file.

## Note

This will not work right away. If this script is being copied into a PowerShell session, you will need to open up a new
session and execute the commands.
